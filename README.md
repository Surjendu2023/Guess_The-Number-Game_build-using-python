# Guess_the_Game_python

Welcome to my first mini project, **Guess the Number** built using Python! ðŸŽ‰

### Overview
This simple yet engaging game is a great way to dive into basic Python programming. In this project, the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player's goal is to guess the number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, helping the player narrow down the correct number.

### Features
1. **Random Number Generation:** The computer selects a random number within a predefined range.
2. **User Interaction:** The game interacts with the player by prompting for guesses and providing hints.
3. **Iteration & Loops:** The game continues until the player successfully guesses the number.
4. **Input Validation:** Ensures that the user enters a valid number.
### Why This Project?
- **Guess the Number** is a perfect starting point for beginners to get hands-on experience with Python's core concepts, such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling. Itâ€™s a fun and straightforward way to strengthen your problem-solving skills and understand the basics of Python programming.
